# Presentation template

Everything custom is in the `custom` folder. The entry point is `index.html`. Edit those files.

## Start the presentation

* `npm install` to install.
* `npm start` to run.

That will serve the presentation on `htttp://localhost:3000`, watch for changes on your files, and reload the webpage.
